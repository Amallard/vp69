#VP-69 Command Website

Welcome VP-69 Webmaster!

The website is fairly straight forward for the most part. <br>
The key points I want to address in this web doc are:
 - The website is based on the Bootstrap framework. Please keep consistent with Bootstrap while this theme is in place. 
 - The Navbar and the Footer are loaded in from jQuery `.load()` function. The external HTML files are located in `assets/include/`
 - Please be very cautious if modifying from NMCI computers. I say this because I'm assuming you must be using Notepad to make modifications to the source code. HTML is very easy to screw up in HTML without a proper code editor. Please try to keep any modications on NMCI computers to a minimum if possible. If there is no reason for an immedaite update, please contact me (YN2 Allard) to make the appropriate adjustments. 
 - Please note: When you make a change to Navbar or Footer and upload it, the changes will not be visible right away. This is because they are loaded via jQuery so they are stored in the browser's cache. Just simply clear the cache and the changes will appear. 
 - Please comment your code. I've done a decent job keeping the source code well commented and documented for ease of maintenance. Let's try and keep it that way.
 - Please format/ indent your code. See the above reasoning.
 
Any questions/ comments/ or concerns regarding the website, please contact me - adam.allard@live.com
